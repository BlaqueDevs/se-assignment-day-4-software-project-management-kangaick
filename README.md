# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management

## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial to ensure the project is done in time to avoid financial constraints. To ensure that the project is done on time they should set up realistic deadlines, monitor expenses, allocate tasks and have regular debriefings for updates.


## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control contributes to the success of a software project as it curbs budget overrun and ensures effective resource allocation. Some strategies to avoid budget overruns is to monitor resources regularly, set a budget beforehand and manage expenses eg considering hiring services instead of purchasing whichever is cheaper and suitable.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology breaks work into iterative steps that can be completed quickly and are done during sprints. Agile gives the team more flexibility  at each stage of SDLC to incorporate user feedback and make changes. Therefore agile is more flexible and has a faster release time as its advantages however agile requires more resources due to its continous monitoring and it is also prone to scope creep as it doesn't have clear boundaries.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential workflow meaning that a phase only begins once the previous one has been completed. These makes it easy to approach as there is alot of clarity on what is required and minimizes the risk of expanding project scope. However this makes it inflexible to changes during development and causes delays and lenghty timelines.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more suitable to creative and innovating projects where market trends shifts and custeomer feedback is taken itno consideration eg uber.
Waterfall is more beneficial to projects that need to be compliant with the industry hence the documenttation must be keenly followed eg procurement and logistics.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Some methods for ensuring quality assurance is by first defining qulaity standards, regular testing to ensure it meets functionality requirements, listen to customer feedback and regularly update and review. It is important to maintain high standards to meet customer satisfaction and stand out in the industry.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope contributes to the sucess of project planning as it defines the boundaries of the project, helps to create a budget based on resources needed and to also have a realistic timeline. A Work Breakdown Structure is a tool used that visually organizes your project and helps to breakdown tasks and allocate them.


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
The benefits of developing a detailed project schedule include; helps to complete the project in the set timeline, helps reduce delays in releasing, helps each member and team to realize their objectives and helps keep track of each task and prioritize them. Gantt charts are helpful in having a detailed project schedule as it helps to monitor projects and schedule tasks in graphs.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The core issues my software aims to address is price gouging by companies and my main target audience is women.


## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem is effective in developing a more effective software solution as it enhances understanding and helps understand the root causes.


## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
I would keep it simple, short and fun to understand by startig off with a hook eg a question to capture their attention, describe the problem by making it relatable and clear, give the solution that my software gives, use a live demo to show how it works then close with a call for action asking for what resources i need eg funding.


## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
The main features include personalisation where customers can input their favourite stores to shop with an online presence as well as a price comparison feature to ensure you are getting the best deal.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
The current data shows that beauty is a growing field and women tend to shop mostly on discount days such as black friday however most companies tend to price gouge hence deceiving their customers. With the growth of internet as a source of information for where to buy beauty products my potential software will be benefitial.


## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
It helps to adapt to market shifts and demand as well as make informed choices and mitigate risks when they arise.
